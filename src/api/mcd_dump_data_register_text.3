.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR mcd_dump_data_register_text ()
function registers text data to be dumped.
.I ident
is a string to identify the text dump later. It must be non-NULL.
If the
.I ident
is not unique, the text dump is appended to previously registered
text dumps with the same
.IR ident .
The data will only be dumped if a scope value greater than or equal to
.I dump_scope
is requested by the
.BR minicoredumper (1).
If
.I save_ptr
is non-NULL, a pointer to the registered dump will be stored there. This
is needed if
.BR mcd_dump_data_unregister (3)
will be used.
.I fmt
is a
.BR printf (3)
format string used to print the text data to a dump file.
The remaining arguments are pointer arguments specified by
.IR fmt .
Each pointer argument must be of a type that is appropriate for the
associated length modifier and conversion specifier in
.IR fmt .
Since the arguments are always pointers, the syntax for these arguments
matches that of
.BR scanf (3).
.PP
The
.BR mcd_vdump_data_register_text ()
function is equivalent to the function
.BR mcd_dump_data_register_text ()
except that it is called with a
.I va_list
instead of a variable number of arguments. These functions do not call the
.I va_end
macro. Because they invoke the
.I va_arg
macro, the value of
.I ap
is undefined after the call. See
.BR stdarg (3).
.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR mcd_dump_data_register_text ()
and
.BR mcd_vdump_data_register_text ()
return 0 on success, otherwise an error value is returned.
.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory available to allocate internal structures.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I ident
was invalid or
.I fmt
was NULL.
.TP
.B EEXIST
A binary dump matching
.I ident
was already registered.
.
.SH EXAMPLE
Register a text dump with 2 different sized variables.
.PP
.RS
.nf
mcd_dump_data_t dd;
unsigned long val1;
unsigned char val2;

mcd_dump_data_register_text("tdump.txt", 6, &dd,
                            "val1=0x%lx val2=0x%hhx\\n",
                            &val1, &val2);

.
.SH BUGS
When dumping, each pointer argument is typecasted based on the
length modifier and conversion specifier associated with that
argument. If this does not match the true type of the variable,
the dumped text may be invalid.
.PP
The string specified in
.I ident
is also the file name of the text dump file. For this reason
characters such as '/' are not permitted.
