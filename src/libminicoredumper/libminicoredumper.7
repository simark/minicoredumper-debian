.SH NAME
libminicoredumper \- a library for registering application data for dumping
with the
.BR minicoredumper (1)
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libminicoredumper
provides an interface for registering binary and text data for dumping with
the
.BR minicoredumper (1).
The data can be dumped into a
.BR core (5)
file (in case this application crashes), or into separate files for simple
access.
.PP
If any data is registered for dumping, an anonymous UNIX domain socket is
used to send a message
.BR minicoredumper_regd (1),
registering this application with
.BR minicoredumper (1).
When some other application crashes, the
.BR minicoredumper (1) will dump the registered data from this application
as well. This feature allows variable information from multiple applications
to be dumped soon after any application crashes. To minimize the time between
an application crash and the dumping of other registered applications,
the
.BR minicoredumper (1)
uses PTRACE_SEIZE and PTRACE_INTERRUPT to temporarily pause registered
applications until all dumping is complete.
